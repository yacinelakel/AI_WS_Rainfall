What is the key driver of change in the insurance industry according to the context?,"According to the context, technology is identified as the key driver of change in the insurance industry. The evolution of technology has brought about digital disruption, enabling new methods for collaboration, optimizing organizational structures, introducing new products and services, and enhancing decision-making abilities. The historical progression from the invention of the Personal Computer and the Internet to the current digital advancements highlights the transformative impact of technology on the insurance sector.","THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY 2025: A Digital Transformation Roadmap2
Digital disruption is coming to the insurance 
industry. On the one hand, new technology threatens existing business models, putting more power into the hands of the customers and paving the way for new market entrants. On the other, technology and digitalisation enables new methods for collaboration, optimisation of existing organisational structures, the emergence of new products and services, and enhanced decision-making abilities. 
Technology has always been the key driver 
of change. The latter half of the 20th century spawned the invention of the Personal Computer and the Internet, replaced mechanical and analogue technology with the widespread use of digital electronics and ushered in the Digital Revolution and the Information Age. 
Today, technology has evolved even further.",1
"According to Professor Klaus Schwab, what characterizes the Fourth Industrial Revolution?","According to Professor Klaus Schwab, the Fourth Industrial Revolution is characterized by emerging technology breakthroughs such as artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, and the Internet of Things (IoT). This technological revolution is disrupting industry after industry, compelling organizations to adapt to the changes brought about by these advancements.","Today, technology has evolved even further. 
According to Professor Klaus Schwab, founder and executive chairman of the World Economic Forum, we are living in the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Characterised by emerging technology breakthroughs, including artificial intelligence (AI), robotics and the Internet of Things (IoT), the present-day technological revolution is disrupting industry after industry, compelling organisations to adapt to the changes. 
The insurance industry is no exception. During 
the next five to seven years, the industry will go through more changes than it has done during the last 50 years. Within 2025, new technology that caters to the complexity of the industry will transform insurance as we know it, new products and risks will emerge, and innovative distribution models will be developed. 
Indeed, there is much talk about adaptability",1
Why is it important to consider the speed of implementation when discussing adaptability and predicting change in IT solutions and work processes?,"It is crucial to consider the speed of implementation because even if an organization excels in predicting and adapting to change, delays in implementing strategies into IT solutions and work processes can hinder the effectiveness of those adaptations. The gap between prediction and implementation can lead to missed opportunities, inefficiencies, and a lack of competitive advantage. Therefore, the timeliness of executing strategies is essential for ensuring that adaptability efforts translate into tangible outcomes in a rapidly changing environment.","Indeed, there is much talk about adaptability 
and the continually increasing speed of change, but the discussion is mostly about regulations, organisation, people and technology trends. However, what good is being best in class, regarding predicting and being aware of how to adapt, if it takes years to implement your strategies into your IT solution and day-to-day work processes?",1
What are the three primary roles that actors in the insurance industry may take before embarking on a digitisation process?,"The three primary roles that actors in the insurance industry may take before digitisation are Disruptor, Early adopter, and Follower. Disruptors are the innovators who reshape the future through innovation, while Early adopters are the thought-leaders and technology champions who invest early in new technology to address concrete problems. Followers are those who only embrace change after seeing the demonstrated benefits of new technology, never becoming thought-leaders themselves.","THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY 2025: A Digital Transformation Roadmap11
Determining One’s Role  
and Course of Action
Before embarking on a digitisation process, 
it is crucial to determine which role one is willing to take in the changing ecosystem and what one’s course of action will be. There are primarily three roles every actor in the industry may take: 
 •Disruptor: These are the insurers and brokers who want to reshape the future through innovation. These disruptive inno-vators are the ones who pave the way for new products in the market, the visionaries willing to try new ideas and take risks along the way.  
 •Early adopter: The thought-leaders and technology champions. The ones who in-vest early in new technology, not as the technologists themselves, but to address their concrete problems. These are the insurers and brokers who understand the importance of change.  
 •Follower: These are the ones who are only willing to jump on board on change as soon as they see the demonstrated benefit of new technology. Followers will naturally never become thought-leaders.",10
What are the three main roles discussed in the context and how do they differ in their approach to technology adoption?,"The three main roles discussed in the context are Followers, Thought-leaders, and Early Adopters. Followers are those who only embrace change when they see the benefits of new technology, while Thought-leaders are the innovators and Early Adopters are the first to embrace new technology. Each role has a different approach to technology adoption, with Followers being cautious, Thought-leaders being innovative, and Early Adopters being quick to adopt new technology.","•Follower: These are the ones who are only willing to jump on board on change as soon as they see the demonstrated benefit of new technology. Followers will naturally never become thought-leaders. 
Neither of these roles is superior to the others. There is no set, ideal one-size-fits-all solution for approaching the digital future. It all depends on the particular situation of one’s business. In the insurance industry, with its long traditions, however, we are likely to see many followers, a few early adopters and a limited number of disruptors.
This choice should not be underestimated. To 
move forward in an increasingly technology-dependent and soon-to-be disrupted industry, this choice should be a conscious one. 
Insurance 2.0:  
4 Essential Changes for the 
Future Insurance Industry
Although the future may be uncertain, there 
are a few important changes that we already know will impact the insurance industry in a significant way.

How will the growing amount of data from connected IoT devices impact the insurance industry's approach to decision-making?,"The growing amount of data from connected IoT devices will enable insurers to tap into new sources of data for more precise predictions of future events. This will allow insurers to make decisions on important tactical, operational, and strategic matters with better accuracy. The shift towards utilizing IoT data will enhance automation, risk assessment, fraud detection, marketing strategies, and provide better customer insights in the insurance industry.","Insurance 2.0:  
4 Essential Changes for the 
Future Insurance Industry
Although the future may be uncertain, there 
are a few important changes that we already know will impact the insurance industry in a significant way.
New Level of Data Analysis
Traditionally, insurers have mainly relied on internal, structured data to influence their decisions on relevant matters. This will undoubtedly change. The amount of data generated from connected IoT-devices is growing radically, and insurers can tap into these new sources of data to more precisely predict future events and decide on important tactical, operational and strategic matters.

marketing, better customer insights and",10
What critical area of focus should insurers prioritize in the coming years to unlock improved customer experience and utilize new sources of data effectively?,"Insurers should prioritize investing in IT systems and platforms that can store, analyze, and utilize the growing amount of data for actual business purposes. This focus is crucial to unlock improved customer experience and leverage new sources of data effectively in the digital transformation of the insurance industry in 2025.","THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY 2025: A Digital Transformation Roadmap12
improved customer experience, are among 
the things that new sources of data will unlock for insurers. However, as the amount of data needed to be handled for these purposes grow so does the need for IT systems and platforms that can store, analyse and utilise the data for actual business purposes. This should be a critical area of focus for insurers in the years to come.
New Level of Efficiency Requirement
Insurance providers and brokers are heavily reliant on back-office operations and regularly spend time on repetitive business practices that prevent them from performing value-producing work. According to NTT Data Consulting’s “The AI Revolution in Insurance: A Reality Check” , underwriters spend as much 
as 70 % of their time performing low-value tasks, such as searching for, aggregating and selecting data, and as little as 30 % of their time in risk selection.
This too will change in the years to come. As",11
What percentage of time do insurance industry professionals currently spend on low-value tasks and risk selection?,"Insurance industry professionals currently spend 70% of their time performing low-value tasks, such as searching for, aggregating, and selecting data, and only 30% of their time in risk selection. This distribution of time is expected to change in the future due to the increasing efficiency demands driven by tech-driven market entrants and the adoption of robotic process automation (RPA) in the industry. McKinsey predicts that up to 25% of full-time positions may be consolidated or replaced over the next ten years as a result of automation, emphasizing the need for insurers to adapt to an automated future.","as 70 % of their time performing low-value tasks, such as searching for, aggregating and selecting data, and as little as 30 % of their time in risk selection.
This too will change in the years to come. As 
tech-driven market entrants threatening to create an Uber- or AirBnB-like disruption in the insurance industry, the level of efficiency required to stay ahead in an increasingly competitive environment rises to a new level. To combat this, the insurance industry is preparing for investments in robotic process automation (RPA) to improve existing business applications. McKinsey  even predicts that 
up to 25 % of full-time positions may be consolidated or replaced over the next ten years as a consequence of automation. Adapting to an automated future should indeed be a focus area for insurers in the years to come – particularly for brokers as we will see in one of the following chapters. 
Changed Customer Behaviour",11
What is a critical success factor for improving customer experience in the insurance industry according to the context?,"A critical success factor for improving customer experience in the insurance industry, as mentioned in the context, is innovation in providing 'live' management reports and statistics. Self-service portals for customer overview have been important, but the development of real-time reports and statistics is highlighted as a key factor for enhancing customer experience. This innovation is seen as vital for the future success of companies in the insurance sector.","Changed Customer Behaviour
As in any other industry, excellent customer service is vital to attract new prospects and reduce customer churn. As Ernst & Young notes, insurance is lagging behind in this area, as 14 % of consumers are very satisfied with the communication they receive from insurers. 
According to McKinsey’s article “The Growth 
Engine: Superior Customer Experience in Insurance” , companies that offer best-in-class 
customer experiences consistently tend to grow faster and more profitably. Top-notch customer service, however, means much more than just adding a new member to the company’s call staff. Let me give you a few examples.
 •Real-time reports and statistics:  Self-service portals for customer overview has been a central part of improving the customer experience for some time now. Lately, however, there have been developments such as providing ‘live’ management reports and statistics. Innovation in this area will be a critical success factor going forward.",11
How are consumers influencing their insurance-buying decisions in the digital age?,"Consumers in the digital age are heavily influenced by social media, with 48% considering comments on social media when making insurance-buying decisions. Additionally, 71% of consumers who have a positive social media service experience with a brand are likely to recommend it to others, as noted by McKinsey.","THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY 2025: A Digital Transformation Roadmap13
 •Omni-channel communications:  
Consumers have gone digital. In fact, 48 % consider comments on social media when making their insurance-buying decisions. Furthermore, McKinsey  notes that 71 % 
of consumers who’ve had a good social media service experience with a brand is likely to recommend it to others.  
 •Value-added services: Personalised services or incentives based on consumer behaviour through data from IoT devices will soon revolutionise the insurance industry. Aviva’s driving app is one example. The app ranks drivers based on their cornering, braking and acceleration, giving car insurance savings to the safest drivers. “The Future of General Insurance Report 2016”  notes that 53 % of insurers plan to 
have an IoT-based offering within the next five years.",12
How will IoT-enabled devices impact the insurance industry in the next five years?,"IoT-enabled devices, such as wearable devices, autonomous cars, sensors in factory plants, and smart homes, will reduce existing risks by helping policyholders improve their health, reduce risky behavior, prevent traffic accidents, predict mechanical faults, and mitigate risks of burglaries, water leakage, and fires. However, the massive adoption of IoT-devices may challenge existing insurance models and give rise to new risks. Insurers must focus on identifying new needs and risks to develop innovative insurance products and services to stay competitive in the evolving market landscape.","have an IoT-based offering within the next five years. 
New ProductsA connected, smart and IoT-enabled world will undoubtedly reduce existing risks. Wearable devices will help policyholders reduce risky behaviour and improve their health. Autonomous cars will reduce traffic accidents. Sensors in factory plants will contribute to predict, identify and act on mechanical faults. What is more, smart homes will reduce the risk of both burglaries, water leakage and fires. 
The massive adoption of IoT-devices indeed 
threatens to undermine existing insurance models. However, new risks will likely emerge. This means insurers should spend time on discovering new needs and risks that require new insurance products and services. This is critical to surviving in an increasingly competitive market. 
Several insurance companies are already 
leveraging the new opportunities inherent in the digital transformation to develop and launch new products for their customers. Before we head off into the next chapter, shifting our focus from the strategic level to the operational, let’s look at some of the new developments for inspirational purposes here: 
 •The US-based company BetterView",12
"How does BetterView, a US-based company, combine insurance services with innovative engineering?","BetterView, a US-based company, combines insurance services with innovative engineering by using drones to capture aerial images.

an alternative solution for the mobile generation by giving them access to an on-demand platform that generates real-time prices for different insurable items.",12
What are some key areas of focus for digitizing the insurance industry according to the context?,"According to the context, some key areas of focus for digitizing the insurance industry include digital disruption, IoT, robotics, analytics, big data, AI, social media, cognitive computing, and machine learning. The challenge lies in understanding how these technologies can benefit the insurance industry rather than just discussing them as buzzwords. It is essential to explain how these technologies can be practically used within the industry to drive digitization efforts effectively.","THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY 2025: A Digital Transformation Roadmap14
3.    Key Areas of Focus:  
  How to Digitise
Digital disruption, IoT, robotics. Analytics, big data, AI. Social media, cognitive computing, machine 
learning. There are so many trends and buzzwords at the moment that it is almost impossible for a mere business manager to follow and understand all of them. 
I have already mentioned a few of these technologies here, but a central point in this e-book is 
that too many talks about these buzzwords without explaining how it may benefit the insurance industry. It is easy to sit down and read a book about big data and robotics and go out and talk about it. However, it is immensely harder to explain how it may be used within the industry. 
When it comes to digitising your business, then, here is a short list of key areas I believe you 
should be focusing your digitisation efforts on. 
1. Think End to End and 
Single Data Entry
Most companies organise themselves",13
What is one of the key areas to focus on when digitising a business according to the given context?,"One of the key areas to focus on when digitising a business, as mentioned in the context, is to think 'End to End and Single Data Entry.' This involves addressing the issue of disconnected systems and fragmented business processes within companies. For example, in the insurance industry, larger companies and brokers often operate multiple disconnected systems leading to inefficiencies in data entry during customer onboarding. By streamlining data entry processes and ensuring single data entry points, businesses can improve efficiency and reduce redundant tasks.","When it comes to digitising your business, then, here is a short list of key areas I believe you 
should be focusing your digitisation efforts on. 
1. Think End to End and 
Single Data Entry
Most companies organise themselves 
according to function with processes and systems that rarely communicate with each other. Sales work certain systems and according to their processes, while marketing work with theirs. IT has their own, and HR yet others. 
It is the same within the insurance industry. 
Most larger insurance companies and brokers usually operate a significant number of different disconnected systems and struggle with fragmented business processes. Indeed, they might even have as many work processes as they have employees. 
Take data entry within the customer 
onboarding process as an example. Data entry is one of the most time-consuming tasks performed on a daily basis. From prospecting via sales to implementation, employees are likely to punch the same numbers several times into various documents and software systems. Additionally, they are likely to spend",13
How can end-to-end automation benefit insurance firms in terms of customer data management and communication efficiency?,"End-to-end automation in insurance firms allows customers to visualize and maintain their own data on a user-friendly self-service portal. It also facilitates automated communication between brokers and insurers, enhancing efficiency. Additionally, real-time data analysis within the portal provides customers with valuable insights, improving overall customer experience and operational efficiency.","End to end, then, encompasses the 
customers’ ability to visualise and maintain their own data and automate communication between brokers and insurers. Let the client maintain their own data on a user-friendly self-service portal, and give them additional value by providing real-time data analysis within this same portal. 2. Automate Everything!
If your business is like most insurance firms, you rely heavily on back-office operations and regularly spend time on repetitive business practices that prevent you from creating value. Ideally, you should spend your time and business knowledge on work that produces value, not punching numbers into a spreadsheet or manually set up reports. 
Examine your business processes and look 
for routine tasks that add little value and are prone to error. Do you have paper-based processes? Do you need to rework various tasks because of human error? Do you have bottlenecks, such as verification steps that lie unhandled for days? These are processes likely to benefit from automation. 
As soon as you have analysed your business",14
What should you do after analysing your business processes and why?,"After analysing your business processes, you should perform a cost/benefit analysis to determine the gains from automating the identified processes. This analysis helps in understanding the financial impact and efficiency improvements that automation can bring to the business. By prioritising the processes based on this analysis, you can systematically automate them one by one, ensuring a strategic and efficient approach to process automation.","As soon as you have analysed your business 
processes, perform a cost/benefit analysis. How much do you gain from automating the processes you have identified? Then, prioritise your processes and automate them one by one.",14
What is the significance of data analysis in the insurance industry's digital transformation roadmap for 2025?,"Data analysis plays a crucial role in the insurance industry's digital transformation roadmap for 2025. The massive amount of data generated from IoT devices and social media requires insurers to reboot their offers, finely calibrate pricing, improve claims handling, engage policyholders, and cut fraud. Insurers need to leverage advanced analytics to innovate data-driven value-added services, as traditional data processing tools are insufficient to handle the complexity of the data. Marketforce's 'The Future of General Insurance Report 2016' emphasizes the need for a well-structured data storage system to unlock the potential of this data for business-specific analysis and decision-making.","THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY 2025: A Digital Transformation Roadmap16
3. Perform Business Specific 
Data Analysis
The amount of data generated from IoT 
devices, social media and other sources of data is massive. According to Marketforce’s “The Future of General Insurance Report 2016” , this data-rich world will force insurers to 
reboot their offers to offset a fall in premium income, finely calibrate pricing, improve claims handling, engage policyholders and cut fraud.
The potential of this data is significant. 
However, the amount of data is so massive and complex that traditional data processing tools are unable to handle them. A well-structured, coherent and comprehensive data storage will allow for advanced analytics that enables innovation of data-driven value-added services. 4. Improve Customer 
Experience
Customers expect the same from you, as 
you expect from the companies you interact with. Fast response times, easy access to relevant customer information and an easy-to-use interface are among the critical focus areas for developing an up-to-date customer experience. 
Thinking end to end, increasing the quality",15
How can valuable data analysis provide added value for customers beyond streamlining and improving business processes in-house?,"Valuable data analysis can provide added value for customers by visualizing the value of products with an automated, user-friendly interface. This visualization can improve customer satisfaction, experience, and loyalty by helping customers understand the benefits of the products more clearly. By showcasing the value in a user-friendly way, customers are more likely to appreciate and engage with the products, leading to enhanced overall customer experience and loyalty.","Thinking end to end, increasing the quality 
of your data, automating your processes and performing advanced analytics will eventually improve customer experience. However, valuable data analysis should not just be utilised for the streamlining and improvement of your business processes in-house. It should also provide added value for your customers. Visualising the value of your products for your customers with an automated, user-friendly interface, will likely improve customer satisfaction, experience and loyalty.",15
What is the first thing you should do when implementing a digitisation strategy in your organisation according to the context?,"The first thing you should do when implementing a digitisation strategy in your organisation is to understand and document your work processes. This involves identifying what your company looks like, recognizing your pain points, and understanding your advantages. It is crucial to have a clear understanding of your business processes to avoid potential pitfalls and ensure a successful digitisation process.","THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY 2025: A Digital Transformation Roadmap17
4.    Navigating the Digital Landscape Successfully:  
  A How-to-Guide for Implementation
A successful digitisation process relies on more than just getting into the right mindset, building 
the proper strategy and setting the right goals. As I mentioned in the introduction, it is useless being able to predict future technological changes if it takes forever to implement them in your IT systems. When it comes to correctly implementing a digitisation process, then, there are a few best practices to follow and a few common pitfalls to avoid. What these are, is the focus of this chapter.
1. Understand Your  
Business Processes
The first thing you should do when implementing a digitisation strategy in your organisation is to understand and document your work processes. What does your company look like? What are your pain points? What are your advantages? This might seem obvious, but surprisingly enough it is not. In fact, I once worked on an IT project which came to an abrupt halt a year into the process after the organisation realised they lacked the proper understanding of their own business processes.",16
What is the importance of understanding your business processes before implementing a digitisation project?,"Understanding your business processes before implementing a digitisation project is crucial to ensure that the project provides real business value. Without this understanding, there is a risk of employees finding workarounds that do not align with the intended goals of the digitisation. Additionally, simply aiming for simplification without a deep understanding of how the business operates can be naive. It is essential to comprehend the workings of the organization at all levels to successfully implement a digitisation process.","Indeed, many who embark on a digitisation 
process quickly realise they lack the necessary insight into their work processes and how to correctly digitise them. Perhaps you have attended a conference about digitisation and though “we need to do this!”, looking for an area within your organisation where digitisation might seem fitting? If so, you should pause for a second and ask yourself what real business value this project will give you. Remember, if your system does not support your business processes, creative employees will find ways to work around it.
Furthermore, there is no shortage of C-level 
executives in the industry desperate to implement a digitisation process for the sole purpose of simplifying their business processes. It is easy to propose “simplification” as the primary motto for a modernisation project, but it is nonetheless naïve. Instead, properly understand how your business works on all levels of your organisation, and include",16
What should you consider when choosing an advisor for your digitisation project according to the context?,"When choosing an advisor for your digitisation project, it is crucial to consider their combination of in-depth industry knowledge and practical experience with applying the proper technology within a complex business environment. Avoid 'book-smart' advisors lacking substantial practical experience as they may not be able to identify risks and apply changes effectively. Look for an advisor who understands your business well, preferably with deep knowledge of banking and insurance, as well as IT, to ensure successful digitisation.","THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY 2025: A Digital Transformation Roadmap18
the people who work with these processes on 
a daily basis. More often than not, they will see things in a different light than yourself. 
2. Choose the Right Advisor
Choosing the wrong advisor for your digitisation project might take you on a journey you wish you hadn’t embarked on. Worst case scenario, the wrong consultant will digitise your business the wrong way, addressing the incorrect needs while deploying the improper technology. 
To advise on advantageous technology, your 
advisor should have a combination of in-depth industry knowledge and practical experience with applying the proper technology within a complex business environment. This mix of competencies is hard to come by. 
Allow me to be your advisor for a moment: 
Stay away from “book-smart” advisers lacking substantial practical experience. Even though they can sound very convincing, their lack of hands-on experience makes them unable to identify risks and apply changes where they will provide the most value. Instead, choose an advisor that properly understand your business, preferably one with deep knowledge of banking and insurance, as  well as IT.",17
What is the biggest barrier to innovation in IT infrastructure according to the context?,"According to the context, the biggest barrier to innovation in IT infrastructure is legacy IT systems. Legacy systems pose challenges in adapting to changing technological environments, hinder easy access to real-time information from multiple sources, limit efficiency and productivity, require time-consuming rewriting of code, and impede the development of new products and services. McKinsey's article 'What Drives Insurance Operating Costs?' highlights that complex legacy systems result in high costs and low productivity for companies.","3. Choose a Flexible IT 
Platform
In chapter two I emphasised the need 
for adaptability in the face of a changing technological environment on a strategic level. The same applies to your IT infrastructure. In fact, the biggest barrier to innovation remains legacy IT. Customers’ demand for easy access to real-time information from multiple sources is in most cases incompatible with legacy systems. Additionally, legacy systems may limit efficiency and productivity, require time-consuming rewriting of legacy code and prevent you from developing new products and services. In their article “What Drives Insurance Operating Costs?” , McKinsey notes 
that complex legacy systems lead to both unnecessary high costs and low productivity.
Many companies invest large sums of money 
in responding to or following a new",17
What are the challenges associated with off-the-shelf IT solutions in the insurance industry according to 'THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY 2025: A Digital Transformation Roadmap' context?,"According to the context, off-the-shelf solutions in the insurance industry face challenges in adequately handling the complexity of insurance. Most off-the-shelf solutions are frameworks that require bespoke assembly for specific requirements, which can be costly and time-consuming. While off-the-shelf solutions offer low initial cost and yearly cost of ownership, they may not provide the necessary support for rapid product launches, advanced data analysis, or adapting to market shifts in the insurance industry.","THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY 2025: A Digital Transformation Roadmap19
market trend in a successful way, but few can 
set up an IT infrastructure that can indeed support such activities effortlessly. Fewer still will have systems that can quickly follow a paradigm shift in the market, support rapid product launches or perform advanced data analysis that foresees unexpected changes or provides insight to reduce operational risk. 
Customised or Off-the-Shelf?
When choosing a flexible IT platform, should you go for a customised solution or an off-the-shelf one? Before it is possible to answer this question, it is important to decide which criteria you go by when making this decision. Will it be a low cost, quick implementation, maximum flexibility solution, or something else? 
Off-the-shelf solutions will indeed give 
unparalleled value for money, in the form of low initial cost and yearly cost of ownership. However, there are not many off-the-shelf solutions that can adequately handle the complexity of insurance. Most are just frameworks that need bespoke assembly for your specific requirements – a process which can prove costly and time-consuming.",18
What are the four steps involved in approaching the digitisation project journey in a more concrete way?,"The four steps involved in approaching the digitisation project journey in a more concrete way are: 1. Designing the new digital customer journey with a customer-centric focus. 2. Redesigning and simplifying internal processes in an agile manner to create new processes with high automation and collaboration, leading to reduced complexity and operational costs. 3. Introducing and implementing 'smart' digitisation and process technologies. 4. Establishing a collaborative and agile culture and organization to replace existing silos.","A customised solution, on the other hand, is 
more likely to give you what you want today, but the cost of implementation and future 
maintenance may be huge. Further, what happens if or when your business requires changes or the technology become obsolete? You will likely end up bearing the total cost of these necessary modifications. 
4. A Digitisation Project 
Journey
The three previous steps help you establish the 
proper groundwork. The following four steps show you how to approach the digitisation project journey in more concrete ways:  
1. Design the new digital customer journey 
with a customer-centric focus 
2. Redesign and simplify internal processes, end-to-end in an agile way of work, ending up in new processes with high degree of automation and collaboration including

"According to The Boston Consulting Group (BCG), what are the four most critical strategies to advance for harvesting the full value inherent in digitisation in the insurance industry?","According to The Boston Consulting Group (BCG), the four most critical strategies to advance for harvesting the full value inherent in digitisation in the insurance industry are: 1. Harnessing the Power of Data by utilizing data from IoT-enabled devices for valuable insights. 2. Utilizing data lakes and data management platforms to store and analyze large amounts of data from various sources. 3. Developing analytics skills in-house or hiring new talent to create value for the business. 4. Redefining the Customer Journey to enhance customer experience and engagement.","THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY 2025: A Digital Transformation Roadmap20
According to The Boston Consulting 
Group (BCG), you need to advance several fundamental strategies to harvest the full value inherent in digitisation. The four most critical are as follows: 
Harness the Power of Data
Data is flowing from all kinds of IoT-enabled devices, whether it is from smartphone apps, website browsing, social media or customer transactions. This data will provide valuable insights and enormous opportunities to harness the power inherent in big data. However, this data needs to be stored and managed in a way that yields predictive modelling and meaningful customer insights. 
Data lakes, data management platforms that 
can hold and analyse large amounts of data information from different sources can be used to store and structure data from multiple sources into a single repository and model data so that it supports decision making, research and innovation. If you don’t have the proper analytics skills in-house, you should consider hiring new talent to create value for your business. 
Redefine the Customer Journey",19
What steps can be taken to meet the changing customer expectations and create a superior user experience?,"To meet the changing customer expectations and create a superior user experience, it is essential to put the end user at the centre of focus. This involves mapping the customer journey, identifying customer pain points, developing prototypes, and testing solutions. By adopting a 'design thinking' approach, organizations can enhance the user experience and build a base of loyal customers through improved interactions and services.","Redefine the Customer Journey
As previously noted, customer expectations have changed, and the customer journey is more complicated than ever. 24/7 availability and seamless interactions across platforms are expected, and the tolerance for service delays and handoffs is limited. To meet these demands, you need to put the end user at the centre of your focus. This means mapping the customer journey, identifying customer pain points, developing prototypes and testing solutions. Through this kind of “design thinking” you can create a superior user experience and establish a base of loyal customers. 
Transform Governance and Explore 
Collaborative Ways of WorkingThe technological development moves fast, and to stay in the race for digital, you need to adopt new ways of working. In practice, this means the following: 
 •Establish collaboration between cross-functional teams to brainstorm ideas
 •Conduct prototyping
 •Run A/B testing
 •Incorporate feedback from your users",19
"What form of governance is needed to establish collaboration between cross-functional teams, conduct prototyping, run A/B testing, and incorporate feedback from users in the context of digital transformation?","In the context of digital transformation, a new form of governance is required where teams are granted more autonomy while management defines goals and strategic objectives. This governance model allows local teams to operate effectively towards corporate goals. Additionally, partnerships with other digital players may be necessary to kick-start the digital transformation process. The governance structure should balance autonomy with alignment to overarching objectives for successful innovation and transformation.","•Establish collaboration between cross-functional teams to brainstorm ideas
 •Conduct prototyping
 •Run A/B testing
 •Incorporate feedback from your users
To do this, you will need a new form of governance, in which your teams are given more autonomy. Management still defines the goals and sets the strategic objectives, but your local teams should be given the freedom to operate in a way that ensures effectivity and a contribution to the overarching corporate goals. It may even be relevant to develop partnerships with other digital players to kick-start the digital transformation. 
Reinforce Innovation Capabilities
You should explore any new opportunities that arise concerning open innovation, incubators, innovation centres and corporate ventures. This will enable you to carry out your digital transformation across three critical dimensions: (1) to become more digitally sophisticated by transforming the core, (2) to become more agile and flexible by restructuring your business and (3) to explore new avenues for cutting-edge innovations.",19

"Why do only a few percent of captives have data readily available about their main risks and claims history, despite its great value and potential to provide invaluable insights?","Only a few percent of captives have data readily available about their main risks and claims history because having all data from the same source to predict and prevent accidents is a complex process. It requires integration of various data sources, advanced analytics capabilities, and a proactive risk management approach. Additionally, some captives may lack the necessary resources, expertise, or technology infrastructure to collect, analyze, and utilize such data effectively. Overcoming these challenges and implementing a comprehensive data strategy is crucial for captives to unlock the full potential of their risk management capabilities and derive valuable insights for stakeholders.","THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY 2025: A Digital Transformation Roadmap21
The digitisation of the insurance industry seems to be inevitable. On the one hand, it will give 
insurers and brokers new challenges. On the other, it may unlock new opportunities, new sources of revenue and improve your overall competitive edge in an industry that is bound to become more competitive. 
Let us close off this e-book by taking a look at how these challenges and opportunities  
may affect three different actors in the insurance industry. 
Captives: More Than  
Risk Management?
Captives are mainly set up for risk management purposes, but could captives provide additional value that may prove even more beneficial to their parent companies? 
How often does a big industry corporation 
have all data about their main risks and their claims history available from the same source, which can then actively be used to predict where the next accident may happen and how to prevent it? Moreover, why do only a few percent of captives have this data readily available, despite the fact that it of great value and could provide the stakeholders with invaluable insights? There are a few main reasons for this:",20
Why is it important for captives to structure all available data for data analysis and how can it assist the parent company with proactive risk management?,"It is important for captives to structure all available data for data analysis because without structured data, it is challenging to perform advanced analysis and gain insights. Structured data can assist the parent company with proactive risk management by providing valuable insights into potential risks and opportunities. Captives need to understand how data can be utilized effectively to enhance risk management strategies and make informed decisions based on data-driven insights.","•Firstly, most captives have not structured all the available data within a source that can easily be used for data analysis. 
 •Secondly, there can be a lack of under -
standing in the captive about how available data can be used to assist the parent com-pany with proactive risk management. 
There are, moreover, no simple ways to perform advanced analysis of your business data without the in-depth business understanding only you can provide. A competent advisor can provide guidance and useful tools for the job, but the real value comes from your own business understanding which, together with the ability to extract and combine data, can create the necessary insights that will result in a better understanding of risks.5.    The Digital Opportunity: 
  3 Case Studies",20
How can the marine and energy insurance industry balance the requirements of standardisation and efficiency with maintaining traditional customer relations and diverse customer needs?,"The marine and energy insurance industry faces a challenge in balancing the need for standardisation and efficiency with maintaining traditional customer relations and meeting diverse customer needs. The industry is pressured to deliver tailored solutions while also valuing traditional customer relationships. To address this, two proposed solutions include adapting existing legacy IT systems and implementing data-driven customer relations strategies. These approaches aim to enhance efficiency and standardisation while still catering to individual customer requirements and maintaining strong customer relationships.","THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY 2025: A Digital Transformation Roadmap22
Marine and Energy: 
Adaptability and Data-Driven 
Customer Relations
Standardisation has been a significant trend 
within the IT world the last ten years. For a complex industry such as marine and energy insurance, this trend has proved to be unfitting. On the one hand, the industry is always challenged by its customers to deliver tailored solutions and products. On the other, it is an industry where traditional customer relations are still valued deeply. 
How, then, can this complexity meet the 
requirements of standardisation and a new level of efficiency, while at the same time maintaining traditional customer relations and diverse customer needs? Let me propose two solutions. 
Firstly, existing legacy IT systems should",21
"How can the existing legacy IT systems be improved to meet the requirements of standardisation, efficiency, and diverse customer needs?","The existing legacy IT systems can be improved by replacing them with an adaptable and flexible IT system. This new system should be capable of handling standardised products as well as offering creative and customer-tailored solutions. It should enable reduced time to market for new product launches, quick implementation of new products into web solutions and documents, seamless upgrades, and easy access to customer statistics.","requirements of standardisation and a new level of efficiency, while at the same time maintaining traditional customer relations and diverse customer needs? Let me propose two solutions. 
Firstly, existing legacy IT systems should 
be replaced by an adaptable and flexible IT system. In short, this means a system that is not only able to handle standardised products but also allows for creative solutions and customer-tailored products. Furthermore, it entails reduced time to market for new product launches, quick implementation of new products into web solutions and documents, seamless upgrades and easy access to customer statistics. 
Secondly, customer relations should become 
data-driven. Marine and energy insurers have a vast amount of data at their disposal which they are just not using. For instance, several banks are now turning towards open banking technology to make financial data available to third-party actors. Insurers and brokers can leverage this data to get better insights into their customers’ financial situation. 
Non-Marine Brokers: Fighting 
Automation with Automation
Imagine a future where everyone can place",21
"In the future insurance ecosystem, what role will traditional brokers play with the rise of automation and portal-based marketplaces for insurance needs?","With the automation and portal-based marketplace for insurance needs on the horizon, traditional brokers may face challenges in justifying their role in the industry value chain. As automation streamlines the process of placing insurance requests and allows providers to bid directly, brokers may need to adapt their services to provide added value or specialized expertise. The future role of brokers could involve personalized advisory services, niche market expertise, or tailored insurance solutions that go beyond the capabilities of automated systems.","Non-Marine Brokers: Fighting 
Automation with Automation
Imagine a future where everyone can place 
all their insurance needs, including all relevant information, in a portal-based marketplace where insurance providers can bid on your request. If this were to happen tomorrow, many traditional brokers would suddenly have a hard time justifying their role in the insurance industry value chain.
This automated future will likely materialise 
within few years. It is not a question of if it will happen, but when it will happen. What, then, will happen to brokers? What role will they play in this future insurance ecosystem?",21
How can brokers in the insurance industry leverage automation and data to adapt to the changing industry environment?,"Brokers in the insurance industry can leverage automation and data by exploiting the data they process, manage, and store better than they currently do. By automating their work processes and utilizing well-structured data storage, brokers can offer new services beyond negotiating insurance policies. Additionally, through advanced analytics on underutilized data, brokers can enhance customer experience and provide added value to customers and other stakeholders in the value chain.","THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY 2025: A Digital Transformation Roadmap23
An automated future may indeed force 
the traditional broker out of the insurance equation as they may become an unnecessary intermediary between the insurer and the insured. However, if brokers were to leverage the opportunities in automation themselves and exploit the data they process, manage and store better than they currently do, they may very well find a renewed role in the changing industry environment. 
For instance, agents sit on data that is 
valuable both to customers and insurance companies. However, most brokers do not utilise this in their day-to-day operations as their current data usually are scattered across various sources. By automating their work processes, brokers may find room to offer new services outside of negotiating insurance policies. And by utilising well-structured, coherent and comprehensive data storage and perform advanced analytics, the underutilised data may be used to leverage improved customer experience and provide additional value to both customers and other stakeholders in the value chain.",22

What are some of the key trends and technologies influencing the digital transformation in the insurance industry according to 'THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY 2025: A Digital Transformation Roadmap' report?,"According to 'THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY 2025: A Digital Transformation Roadmap' report, key trends and technologies influencing the digital transformation in the insurance industry include the pressure from digital natives with higher customer expectations, the threat from FinTechs, tech giants, and start-ups entering the market, the emergence of P2P insurance and autonomous vehicles challenging existing models, and the adoption of technologies like Blockchain, smart contracts, and IoT driving the transformation.","THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY 2025: A Digital Transformation Roadmap5
1.    Trends and Technologies
Like many other industries, the insurance industry faces radical transformation. A new generation 
of digital natives is pressuring insurers and brokers into the digital landscape with higher customer expectations than ever before. FinTechs, tech giants and start-ups looking to enter the market threatens industry incumbents, and P2P insurance and autonomous vehicles will undermine existing insurance models.  
Underlying these trends is a rapidly evolving technological development. Blockchain, smart 
contracts and IoT, amongst others, are all driving the digital transformation. I will begin by examining these trends and technologies, and identify how they will influence the insurance industry. 
InsurTechs and  
New Market Entrants 
Insurance is all about assessing risk. The 
more data one has available, the better risk analysis one can perform. This makes the insurance market ripe for entrance by tech giants with massive amounts of aggregated customer data. In fact, one-fifth of the respondents in Marketforce’s “The Future of General Insurance 2016”  believe Google’s data",4
What percentage of insurance companies believe that some part of their business is at risk of disruption according to PwC's survey on InsurTech?,"According to PwC's survey on InsurTech, 74% of insurance companies believe that some part of their business is at risk of disruption. This indicates a high level of concern within the insurance industry about potential disruptions from emerging technologies and innovative companies like InsurTechs and FinTechs. The survey highlights the growing awareness among insurers of the need to adapt and innovate in order to stay competitive in a rapidly changing market landscape.","capabilities, financial muscle and web ubiquity make it the most likely contender to disrupt the insurance market.However, not only tech giants are threatening to disrupt the insurance market. In their survey “Opportunities Await: How InsurTech is Reshaping Insurance” , PwC notes that 74 % of 
insurance companies believe that some part of their business is at risk of disruption, and as much as 90 % of insurers tell they fear losing part of their business to FinTechs. 
In banking, FinTechs – companies that use 
new technology and innovation to compete with traditional financial institutions – are already disrupting the incumbents. Earlier in 2017, Forbes described how newcomer ClearBank is disrupting the financial industry. Having freed themselves from legacy technology and implemented cloud",4
What percentage of financial institutions have put disruption at the heart of their strategy according to PwC's 'Global FinTech Report'?,"According to PwC's 'Global FinTech Report', 56% of financial institutions have put disruption at the heart of their strategy. This indicates a significant focus on embracing change and innovation within the financial industry to stay competitive and meet evolving consumer needs.","THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY 2025: A Digital Transformation Roadmap6
infrastructure, they deliver open access to 
payment, current account and transactional clearing services, ultimately engaging the digital consumer in a way that fits their needs. 
According to PwC’s “Global FinTech Report” , 
56 % of financial institutions have put 
disruption at the heart of their strategy, and 82 % expect to increase FinTech partnerships in the next three to five years. What is more, several FinTechs have their eyes set on the insurance industry. 
InsurTech, a subset of FinTech looking to 
utilise technology to transform the insurance industry, has its eyes set on improving customer experience and simplify policy management. These new market entrants will eventually lead to increased competition, change the insurance industry ecosystem for good and force incumbents to become digital.
Higher Customer 
Expectations and New 
Customer Behaviour
The InsurTechs mentioned above largely",5
What are some key factors contributing to the changes in consumer behavior in the insurance industry?,"The key factors contributing to the changes in consumer behavior in the insurance industry include higher customer expectations, the influence of the Internet in making customers more informed, the shift of power from insurer to consumer, the different expectations of the tech-savvy Gen Y generation compared to the baby boomer generation, the importance of social media in customer service, and the trend of customers connecting with companies through various channels like mobile and social media.","Higher Customer 
Expectations and New 
Customer Behaviour
The InsurTechs mentioned above largely 
caters to recent changes in consumer behaviour. Indeed, today, customers expect more from insurers and brokers. The widespread dissemination of information through the Internet has made customers smarter than ever and shifted the power from insurer to consumer. Furthermore, the tech-savvy Gen Y generation, making up a large part of the population, have different expectations than the baby boomer generation. Social media has become a valid arena for providing customer service, and customers are connecting with companies in more ways than ever. 
According to CapGemini’s “World Insurance 
Report 2016” , customer experience has 
improved globally, but Gen Y customers (people born during the 1980s or early 1990s) are holding the overall customer experience level down. Gen Y customers are omnichannel users, engaging with insurers in a wide variety of channels, particularly through mobile and social media. What is more, Gen Y consumers are more likely to purchase insurance from non-traditional insurers.

What is the potential impact of blockchain on the insurance industry according to the context?,"According to the context, blockchain is expected to revolutionize the insurance industry by changing how ownership is transferred, decisions are made, and business transactions are conducted. It eliminates the need for middlemen like brokers, bankers, and insurers in secure transactions. Blockchain is described as the next generation of the Internet, focusing on moving value rather than just information. The potential of blockchain in the insurance industry is seen as enormous and transformative.","THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY 2025: A Digital Transformation Roadmap7
Blockchain and  
Smart Contracts
Blockchain has already made headlines. 
Hailed as the next generation of Internet, blockchain will come to change how we transfer ownership, make decisions, business transactions and even run our communities and cities. While the Internet is designed to move and store information, blockchain moves value. Where the Internet is dependent on middlemen, such as brokers, bankers and insurers, to execute secure transactions, blockchain removes these middlemen. 
The potential of blockchain is enormous.",6
"According to a survey by Cognizant, Marketforce, and Pegasystems, what do many finance and insurance executives believe about blockchain's impact on financial services?","Many finance and insurance executives believe that blockchain will be the most significant development to affect financial services since the Internet, as revealed in a survey conducted by Cognizant, Marketforce, and Pegasystems. They anticipate that future contracts, known as smart contracts, could be securely stored in digital code within transparently distributed databases, safeguarded against deletion, manipulation, and changes. This advancement could lead to deals, payments, and transactions being uniquely signed digitally, enabling identification, validation, storage, and sharing, potentially disrupting traditional brokers, insurers, and bankers in the industry.","The potential of blockchain is enormous. 
Indeed, many finance and insurance executives believe blockchain will be the most significant development to affect financial services since the Internet, according to a survey done by Cognizant, Marketforce and Pegasystems. Future contracts, so-called smart contracts, may be stored in digital code and transparently distributed databases and be protected against deletion, manipulation and changes. Deals, payments and transactions between customers and companies can be given a unique digital signature that can be identified, validated, stored and shared, ultimately threatening to remove brokers, insurers and bankers altogether. 
Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Insurance
One emerging trend within InsurTech is peer-to-peer (P2P) insurance. Closely related to the concept of the sharing economy, P2P insurance is, in short, a risk-sharing network where a group of people pool their premiums together to insure themselves against risks. 
Lemonade, a New York-based insurance",6
"How does Lemonade, a New York-based insurance company, implement a P2P business model in their operations?","Lemonade, a New York-based insurance company, implements a P2P business model by having policyholders pay their premiums into a claims pool. If there's any money left in the pool at the end of the policy period, the policyholders receive a refund. This model emphasizes self-service technology as the engine of their business, promoting transparency and customer benefits through a peer-to-peer insurance approach.","Lemonade, a New York-based insurance

They offer an insurance model where policyholders pay their premiums into a claims pool. Then, if there’s any money left in the pool when the policy period ends, the policyholders get a refund.  
Insurers can use blockchain to succeed with 
P2P insurance. Although P2P already is used as a business model within the insurance industry, such as by Lemonade, McKinsey notes in their report “Blockchain in insurance – opportunity or threat?”  that blockchain may 
make P2P insurance even more transparent and trustworthy for consumers as no central authority controls its operation.",6
What is the Internet of Things (IoT) and how is it impacting our connected world?,"The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a network of physical devices that can collect and exchange data, enabling communication between devices. In our increasingly connected world, IoT is transforming various aspects such as smart homes, smart cities, and wearable technology. For example, smart homes use IoT devices to monitor household activities, while smart cities utilize IoT for efficient management of assets and utilities. The number of connected IoT devices is rapidly increasing, with predictions ranging from 20.4 billion to 50 billion devices by 2020, indicating the significant impact of IoT on connectivity and data exchange.","THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY 2025: A Digital Transformation Roadmap8
The Internet of Things
We are living in an increasingly connected 
world. Smart homes, equipped with devices and appliances that monitor various aspects of the household and communicate with each other, is one example. Smart cities, with its technology-driven communications and management of different assets, organisations and utilities, is a second. Even we as humans become more connected as we put on “wearables”, such as biometric clothes and smartwatches.
These technological developments are 
broadly categorised as the Internet of Things (IoT), a network of physical devices able to collect and exchange data and communicate with each other. And the number of connected IoT devices is growing radically. According to Gartner , 8.4 billion connected 
devices will be in use in 2017, a number they predict will rise to 20.4 billion by 2020. And Gartner resides at the conservative end of the spectrum; Cisco predicts the number of connected devices in use by 2020 to be 50 billion.
In any case, the growing number of IoT",7
How will the growing number of IoT devices transform the insurance industry?,"The growing number of IoT devices will transform the insurance industry by helping policyholders reduce and manage risk, ultimately leading to a decrease in premium income as the demand for insurance decreases. This transformation will force insurers and brokers to rethink their existing offers while providing valuable streams of data. Data from connected devices can be used to finely calibrate pricing, improve claims handling, engage policyholders, and reduce fraud according to 'The Future of General Insurance Report 2016'.","In any case, the growing number of IoT 
devices will transform the insurance industry as we know it. Generally speaking, it will help policyholders reduce and manage risk, ultimately reducing premium income as the demand for insurance lowers. 
On the one hand, this will force insurers and 
brokers to rethink their existing offers. On the other, it provides valuable streams of data. “The Future of General Insurance Report 2016” notes that data from connected devices have the potential to finely calibrate pricing, improve claims handling, engage policyholder and cut fraud. 
Autonomous Transportation and Shipping
Autonomous transportation and shipping is one example of how IoT may influence the insurance industry. Self-driving cars have been on the mind of forward-thinking technologists since the 1920s. Today, computer-driven, sensor- and software-packed cars are becoming a fact. 
Ford, for instance, plans to roll out driverless 
cars without steering wheels and pedals by 2021, and Tesla is set to make their cars self-driving and autonomous within 2018. The safety benefits are significant. According to 
McKinsey , autonomous vehicles bear the",7
"According to McKinsey, what potential reduction in car accidents do autonomous vehicles bear?","According to McKinsey, autonomous vehicles bear the potential of reducing car accidents by up to 90%. This significant reduction in car accidents is one of the safety benefits associated with self-driving and autonomous cars. The prediction highlights the potential positive impact of autonomous technology on road safety and accident prevention, leading to a substantial decrease in the number of car crashes and related injuries.","cars without steering wheels and pedals by 2021, and Tesla is set to make their cars self-driving and autonomous within 2018.

What is the timeline for the transition of the Yara Birkeland ship to autonomous operation and unmanned status?,"The Yara Birkeland ship, produced by Kongsberg Gruppen AS and Yara ASA, will embark on manned voyages in 2018 and set sail entirely on its own in 2020. It is expected to be completely unmanned by 2035, with a gradual transition towards reduced crew and remote support starting in 2020.","THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY 2025: A Digital Transformation Roadmap9
next 15 to 20 years. The Norwegian ship 
Yara Birkeland, produced by the Norwegian maritime technology firm Kongsberg Gruppen AS and the fertiliser manufacturer Yara ASA, will embark on manned voyages already in 2018 and set sail entirely on its own in 2020. The marine branch of Rolls-
Royce  has partnered up with the Advanced 
Autonomous Waterborne Applications in Finland to develop the necessary technology for self-driving ships. With sensor technology, control algorithms and communication and connectivity as the technological fundament, their autonomous ships will set sail in 2020, with a reduced crew and remote support, and be completely unmanned by 2035. 
The US Coast Guard attributes as much as 
96 % of marine casualties to human error. With ships that can monitor its health, communicate what is around them and make decisions based on that information will undoubtedly impact marine insurers. However, new technology carries with it new types of risk, particularly regarding cyber security and data breaches. 
Legacy Thinking and 
Conservativism Inhibiting 
Digital Change?",8
Why has the insurance industry been slow to adopt new digital approaches according to the context?,"The insurance industry has been slow to adopt new digital approaches due to its perceived conservatism and resistance to change. While there are smart and innovative individuals within the industry, the challenge lies in effectively utilizing technology to create business advantages. FinTechs often discuss trends without providing concrete examples of how technology can benefit insurers, making it difficult for the industry to embrace digital change.","Legacy Thinking and 
Conservativism Inhibiting 
Digital Change?
As with all disruption, the transformation of 
the insurance industry promises both threats and opportunities. I hope to have illustrated both in this chapter. Nevertheless, it seems to be no doubt that digitisation of the insurance industry is inevitable. 
The insurance industry has been slow to 
adopt new digital approaches. One excuse often made about the insurance business’ resistance to change is that it is overly conservative. But this conjecture is all too easy to make. The business advantages technology can provide are plain to see, and there is no shortage of smart and innovative people within the industry. 
The reason may be that FinTechs are talking 
more about the trends than explaining how technology can be utilised to create advantages for businesses. It is easy for people in the tech industry to talk about big data and robotics, but to explain how these technologies can be used for specific business advantages for an insurer is harder. 
The primary challenge, however, is to adapt to",8
